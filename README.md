# Implementation-of-Recommender-System
## Description of the project
I implemented three different recommender systems including Collaborative Filtering Recommender System, Content-based Recommender System and Hybrid Recommender System. In the evaluation part, I used the Rank Based Utility Measures and the Error Based Measure to see how well my recommender systems perform.

## Description of the Datasets
I used the "5-core" subset and "complete review data" datasets from the "Software" category of the Amazon Review Data (2018). (See https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html)
